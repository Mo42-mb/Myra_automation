This package will help you use the coding interface in the BMS Workbench software for the BMC Myra Liquid Handling Robot. 

First, open samples_template.xlsx and resave with your experiment name. 
Enter your sample information in the "R" sheet. Ignore technical replicates for this. One sample represents all technical replicates.
Enter your plate set-up in the "map_view" sheet. Include all technical replicates in this map, exaclty how you will place them in your physical plate. 
The locked sheets in this file will ensure your samples are mapped to the correct well.

Next, open "Write_myra_scripts.R"
Enter all required information as directed by "USER INPUT". This includes updating your working directory, file name, sample number, number of technical reps per sample, transfer volumes, and tube sizes. This roughly encompasses lines 11-40. 

Last, run the remaining code in "Write_myra_scripts.R" to create an "output" sub-directory with a csv file to upload in the BMS Workbench sample tab and copy in the scripts (each for an individual run) in the scripts tab.

This is a quick and easy way to ensure that you are correctly adding "genes" and "treatments" in an interactive way based on what is specified by your spreadsheet foreach well in the plate.
